## Steps for running:
0. Do it once: 
   - download and install [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/releases/), version: 12.22.6 
     
    or 
   - install Node.js with [Node.js Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm). 
     
        Using `nvm` (Node.js Version Manager) makes it easier to install and manage multiple versions of Node.js on a single local environment.
    
        To install a specific version of node: `nvm install 12.22.6`


1. Install packages that project depends on: `npm install`
2. Run application locally: `ng serve` or `npm run start`
   

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
